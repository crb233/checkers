# Checkers!

Our CS 451 final project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/crb233/checkers).
Implements a user-friendly web application for playing checkers online.



## Authors

Curtis Bechtel, Hajer Karoui, Sam Nathanson, and Julie Soderstrom



## Notes

This project is being written as a publicly available web application with a
central server to connect players with each other.

Screenshots as proof of code coverage can be found at `doc/code_coverage/`.

Screenshots as proof of static code analysis can be found at
`doc/static_analysis/`.

Project release notes are contained in `CHANGELOG.md`

The final test case document can be found at
`doc/Checkers Test Case Document.pdf`

We used a package to automatically generate documentation for many of our
modules, functions, and variables. This can be generated through NPM by running
`$ npm run make-doc` and then viewed in `doc/api/index.html`



## Platforms and Services

The server side code is written in Node.js using NPM packages such as Express
and BodyParser. It is being hosted on [Heroku](cs-451-checkers.herokuapp.com).

The database uses MongoDB and is hosted on mLab.

The client is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the use of JQuery for
easier asynchronous HTTP requests.
